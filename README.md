# Data_Preprocessing
Includes data preprocessing steps, merging dataframes, PCA analysis, data distribution visualization (demonstarted using 3 columns & box plot). The dataset is collected from **Kaggle**. The dataset is split into train and test files into .csv format. I have merged both .csv files to perform preprocessing tasks. Handling **duplicate** and **null** values are basic steps. At first I have removed duplicates and null values but later on imputation methods has been introduced to remove missing values. **KNNImputer** is used to perform the task. <br>
**PCA Analysis** is dimensionality reduction technique and I reduced the dimensionality into 3D. <br>
